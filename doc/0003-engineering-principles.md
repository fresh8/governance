# 3. Engineering Principles

Date: 2018-09-18

## Status

Proposed

## Context

Our engineering principles provide a framework for our decision making as a team, based on goals we're trying to achieve. These principles are rules made by the engineering team in order to align what we're doing to the broader goals of the company. These principles will evolve and develop over time.

## Decision

Below are the initial 13 principles proposed by the engineering team, along with descriptions to clarify their concept.

### Security conscious


### All behaviour should be observable


### Working technology


### Automation over complex manual process


### Fail friendly environment


### Cross platform flexibility


### Fix it stable!

Aim to ship stable software whilst staying agile. Everyone is responsible for quality, using methods, tooling, and processes to prevent bugs, and prioritising bug fixes over new development.

### Optimise Proportionally

Always look for optimisations, implementing when the change is proportionate for the problem being solved.

### One team with the same goal, celebrating and respecting our differences


### All responsible for our code


### No surprises


### Data driven decision making


### Invest in teams, not projects


## Consequences

Decision processes within the team should align with our principles, with deviations being raised to team leads. Deviations may mean a change in principles are required, or should highlight issues with development work or processes that require re-alignment.
